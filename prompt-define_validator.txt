I need help creating a custom validation rule for insurance data analysis in Python. Please guide me through the process step by step.
Here's what you should know:

The validation system uses Polars DataFrames/LazyFrames for data processing
Each validation rule is an object with:

A name (string)
A validation function that takes a DataFrame and column name(s)
List of columns the rule applies to
A severity level (ERROR, WARNING, or INFO)
A custom message for when validation fails



The validation function should:

Return records that FAIL validation (not ones that pass)
Use Polars syntax for filtering
Return a LazyFrame of the failing records

Example of an existing rule:
ValidationRule(
    name="premium_not_zero",
    validation_func=lambda df, col: df.filter((pl.col(col) <= 0) | pl.col(col).is_null()),
    columns=["premium"],
    message="Premium must be greater than zero"
)
Can you help me create a validation rule for [describe your validation need]? Please include:

What columns are involved
What conditions indicate a validation failure
How severe the validation failure should be
What message should be shown when validation fails

After you provide these details, I can help you construct the appropriate validation rule with proper Polars syntax.
